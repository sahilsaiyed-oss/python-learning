# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my **complete Python learning journey**, starting from core fundamentals and ending with **mini projects and mega projects**.

It is not a copy of tutorials — every folder represents **hands-on practice, experiments, and revisions** done during learning.

## 📌 What’s Inside

### 📘 Chapter-wise Learning
Each chapter is divided into:
- `xx-chapter` → Concept learning & examples
- `xx-practice` → Practice problems & self-tested code

Topics covered include:
- Variables, Data Types
- Conditional Statements & Loops
- Functions & Recursion
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- File Handling
- OOP in Python
- Modules & Packages

## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 Project 1 – Core Python Practice
Small scripts and logic-building programs.

### 🔹 Project 3 – Mega Jarvis
A Python-based personal assistant project built while learning:
- Python scripting
- Libraries usage
- Modular code structure

### 🔹 Project 4 – AI AutoReply Bot
An experimental project focused on:
- Automation
